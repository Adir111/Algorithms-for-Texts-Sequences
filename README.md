# Algorithms for Text and Sequence Processing
This repository contains coursework from the "Algorithms for Reading Texts Efficiently" course at Ort Braude College.

### Structure
Each folder corresponds to a separate homework assignment. Inside each assignment folder, you'll find it's README.md file with details about the project's structure.

### Purpose
The course focuses on efficient algorithms for processing and analyzing texts and sequences. Assignments cover a variety of topics such as pattern matching, suffix structures, compression, and other text-based algorithmic techniques.
